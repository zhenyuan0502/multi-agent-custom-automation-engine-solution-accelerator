### Overview

Problem:
Agentic AI systems are set to transform the way businesses operate, however it can be fairly complex to build an initial MVP to demonstrate this value. 

Solution:
The Multi-Agent-Custom Automation Engine Solution Accelerator provides a ready to go application to use as the base of the MVP, or as a reference, allowing you to hit the ground running.

### Technology Note
This accelerator uses the AutoGen framework from Microsoft Research.  This is an open source project that is maintained by [Microsoft Research’s AI Frontiers Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/research/lab/ai-frontiers/). Please see this [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/autogen/microsofts-agentic-frameworks-autogen-and-semantic-kernel/) for the latest information on using the AutoGen framework in production solutions.

### Use cases / scenarios
The multi-agent approach allows users to utilize multiple AI agents simultaneously for repeatable tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency. 
The agents collaborate with a manager on various assignments for onboarding a new employee, such as HR and tech support AI working together to set up software accounts, configure hardware, schedule onboarding meetings, register employees for benefits, and send welcome emails. Additionally, these agents can handle tasks like procurement and drafting press releases.

### Business value
Multi-agent systems represent the next wave of Generative AI use cases, offering entirely new opportunities to drive efficiencies in your business. The Multi-Agent-Custom-Automation-Engine Solution Accelerator demonstrates several key benefits:

- **Allows people to focus on what matters:** by doing the heavy lifting involved with coordinating activities across an organization, peoples’ time is freed up to focus on their specializations.
- **Enabling GenAI to scale:** by not needing to build one application after another, organizations are able to reduce the friction of adopting GenAI across their entire organization. One capability can unlock almost unlimited use cases.
- **Applicable to most industries:** these are common challenges that most organizations face, across most industries.

Whilst still an emerging area, investing in agentic use cases, digitization and developing tools will be key to ensuring you are able to leverage these new technologies and seize the GenAI moment.

### Technical key features

This application is an AI-driven orchestration system that manages a group of AI agents to accomplish tasks based on user input. It uses a FastAPI backend to handle HTTP requests, processes them through various specialized agents, and stores stateful information using Azure Cosmos DB. The system is designed to:

- Receive input tasks from users.
- Generate a detailed plan to accomplish the task using a Planner agent.
- Execute the plan by delegating steps to specialized agents (e.g., HR, Procurement, Marketing).
- Incorporate human feedback into the workflow.
- Maintain state across sessions with persistent storage.

This system is intended for developing and deploying custom AI solutions for specific customers. This code has not been tested as an end-to-end, reliable production application- it is a foundation to help accelerate building out multi-agent systems. You are encouraged to add your own data and functions to the agents, and then you must apply your own performance and safety evaluation testing frameworks to this system before deploying it.

  <summary><b>Deploy in your local environment</b></summary>

### Local environment

To run the solution site and API backend only locally for development and debugging purposes, See the [local deployment guide](./documentation/LocalDeployment.md).

 </details>

### Deploying

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces) or in [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers) or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure following the following steps. 

To change the azd parameters from the default values, follow the steps [here](./documentation/CustomizingAzdParameters.md). 


1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

    ```sh
    azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
   ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (like "macaeapp")
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location which has quota for all the resources. 
    * This deployment will take *7-10 minutes* to provision the resources in your account and set up the solution with sample data. 
    * If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the resources.
5. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the App Service and get the app URL from `Default domain`.

6. You can now delete the resources by running `azd down`, if you are done trying out the application. 
<!-- 6. You can now proceed to run the [development server](#development-server) to test the app locally, or if you are done trying out the app, you can delete the resources by running `azd down`. -->

<h2>
Additional Steps
</h2>

1. **Add App Authentication**
   
    Follow steps in [App Authentication](./documentation/azure_app_service_auth_setup.md) to configure authentication in app service.

    Note: Authentication changes can take up to 10 minutes 

2. **Deleting Resources After a Failed Deployment**

     Follow steps in [Delete Resource Group](./documentation/DeleteResourceGroup.md) If your deployment fails and you need to clean up the resources.

### Run locally and debug

To debug the solution, you can use the Cosmos and OpenAI services you have manually deployed.  To do this, you need to ensure that your Azure identity has the required permissions on the Cosmos and OpenAI services. 

- For OpenAI service, you can add yourself to the ‘Cognitive Services OpenAI User’ permission in the Access Control (IAM) pane of the Azure portal.  
- Cosmos is a little more difficult as it requires permissions be added through script.  See these examples for more information: 
  - [Use data plane role-based access control - Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/security/how-to-grant-data-plane-role-based-access?tabs=built-in-definition%2Cpython&pivots=azure-interface-cli) 
  - [az cosmosdb sql role assignment | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/cosmosdb/sql/role/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest#az-cosmosdb-sql-role-assignment-create) 

Add the appropriate endpoints from Cosmos and OpenAI services to your .env file.  
Note that you can configure the name of the Cosmos database in the configuration.  This can be helpful if you wish to separate the data messages generated in local debugging from those associated with the cloud based solution.  If you choose to use a different database, you will need to create that database in the Cosmos instance as this is not done automatically.

If you are using VSCode, you can use the debug configuration shown in the [local deployment guide](./documentation/LocalDeployment.md).

### How to customize

This solution is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify the front end site, or even build your own front end and attach to the backend API. You can further customize the backend by adding your own agents with their own specific capabilities. Deeper technical information to aid in this customization can be found in this [document](./documentation/CustomizeSolution.md).

### Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.
However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) for the resources:

* Azure AI Foundry: Free tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-studio/)
* Azure AI Services: S0 tier, defaults to gpt-4o. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/)
* Azure Container App: Consumption tier with 0.5 CPU, 1GiB memory/storage. Pricing is based on resource allocation, and each month allows for a certain amount of free usage. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)
* Azure Container Registry: Basic tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/)
* Azure Cosmos DB: [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cosmos-db/autoscale-provisioned/)


⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
